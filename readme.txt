ASxxxx and ASlink V5.31 March 2019

   The  ASxxxx  assemblers are a series of microprocessor assem-
blers written in the C programming  language.   This  collection
contains  cross  assemblers  for the 1802, S2650, SC/MP, MPS430,
6100, 61860,  6500,  6800(6802/6808),  6801(6803/HD6303),  6804,
6805,  68HC(S)08,  6809,  68HC11, 68HC(S)12, 68HC16, 740, 78K/0,
78K/0S,  8008,  8008S,  8048(8041/8022/8021)  8051,  8085(8080),
8X300(8X305),   DS8XCXXX,   AVR,   EZ80,   F2MC8L/FX,   F8/3870,
GameBoy(Z80), H8/3xx, Cypress PSoC(M8C), PIC, Rabbit  2000/3000,
ST6,  ST7,  ST8,  Z8, Z80(HD64180), and Z280 series microproces-
sors.   The  companion  program  ASLINK is  a  relocating linker
supporting  all the cross  assemblers.   ASLINK  also   supports
object   files   created   with   V4.xx  and   V3.xx assemblers.
The assemblers and linker have been tested  using  Linux, DJGPP,
Cygwin,  Symantec C/C++ V7.2,  Turbo C++ 3.0,  Open Watcom V1.9,
VC6, Visual Studio 2005, 2010, 2013 and 2015.  Complete   source
code and  documentation for  the   assemblers  and   linker   is
included   with  the distribution.  Additionally, test code  for
each assembler and several microprocessor monitors (ASSIST05 for
the  6805,  MONDEB and  ASSIST09  for the 6809, and  BUFFALO 2.5
for the 6811)  are  included  as  working  examples  of  use  of
these assemblers.
